\title{Calculate Retention Time Consistency (of a Peak Group)}
\usage{
calculateRetentionTimeConsistency(peakData, pts)
}
\arguments{
\item{peakData}{A vector containing characteristic information about a chromatographic peak - including the retention time range}

\item{pts}{A 2D matrix containing the retention time and intensity values of a chromatographic peak}
}
\value{
The Retention Time Consistency of a Peak Group (double)
}
\description{
Calculates the Retention Time Consistency of each chromatographic peak in a group of samples. For each sample, the Retention Time
Consistency is found by calculating the difference between the time at the center of the sample peak and the mean
time of all peak centers normalized by the mean time of all the peak centers.
