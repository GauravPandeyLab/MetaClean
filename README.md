# **MetaClean**: Detection of Low-Quality Peaks in Untargeted LC-MS Metabolomics Data
MetaClean utilizes 11 peak-quality metrics and 8 diverse machine learning algorithms to build a classifier to detect and flag low-quality peaks in untargeted metabolomics data. It is an R package and can be easily incorporated into existing untargeted LC-MS metabolomics pipelines that utilize the pre-processing software XCMS.

The 11 peak-quality metrics used by MetaClean are adapted from the following publications: <br />
